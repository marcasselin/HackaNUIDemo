We carefully analyze the company’s culture, goals and vision; then we carefully analyze the candidate’s personalities, abilities, work ethics and goals to determine if there is a good fit. It truly is an art and we are exceptional at it after fine-tuning our skills over the last 15 years.</x:String>
